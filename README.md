# VSCode_Configuration
This is my vscode configuration. It is not final yet. I am basically a C programmer so I don't need fancy 
configurations. VSCode settings.json file is located in:

    Windows %APPDATA%\Code\User\settings. json.
    macOS $HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings. json.
    Linux $HOME/. config/Code/User/settings. json.
